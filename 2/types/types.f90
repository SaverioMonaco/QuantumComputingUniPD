! Week 2, Exercise 3: Derived Types
!   In Fortran90 write a MODULE which contains a double complex matrix derived TYPE that includes
!   the components: Matrix elements, Matrix Dimensions, Matrix Trace, and Matrix Determinant.
!   (a) Define the correspondent TYPE.
!   (b) Define a function/subroutine that initializes this new TYPE
!   (c) Define the functions/subroutines Trace and Adjoint
!   (d) Define the correspondent Interfaces of the previous points.
!   (e) Define a subroutine that writes on file the Matrix TYPE in a readable form.
!   (f) Include everything in a test program.
