! Week 1, Exercise 3: Test performance
!   Matrix matrix multiplication is many times the bottleneck of linear algebra computations.
!   (a) Write explicitely the matrix-matrix multiplication loop in two different orders.
!   (b) Use the Fortran intrinsic function.
!   (c) Increase the matrix size and use the Fortran Function CPUTIME to monitor the code performance.
!   (d) Use the compiler different optimization flags and monitor the performances
