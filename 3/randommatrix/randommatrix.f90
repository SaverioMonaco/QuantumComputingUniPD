! Week 3, Exercise 3: Random Matrix Theory
!  Study P (s), the distribution of the s i defined in the previous exercise, accumulating values of s i from
!  different random matrices of size at least N = 1000.
!  (a) Compute P (s) for a random HERMITIAN matrix.
!  (b) Compute P (s) for a DIAGONAL matrix with random real entries.
!  (c) Fit the corresponding distributions with the function:
!      P(s) = as α exp(−bs β )
!      and report α, β, a, b.
!      Hint: if necessary neglect the first matrix eigenvalue.
